 *  city that shares its state's name is a conventional label, not a repetition, and
 *  dropping half of it makes the place more ambiguous rather than less. "New York,
 *  New York" is how that city is written, and "New York" alone could be either the

 *

 *  ("Paris Street Cafe") does not swallow the locality — with one exception: a
 *  segment that is a place followed by its postal code ("Bristol BS9 2UN",
 *  "CO 80123") states that place, and whole-segment matching alone cannot see it.
 *  Such a segment counts twice, as itself and as its postcode-stripped form, so the
 *  field is recognised as a repeat. The postcode is only stripped for COMPARISON —
 *  the name still renders whole, because a calendar export wants the code.
 *
 *  Positional: the result has one slot per input, `undefined` where a part was
 *  dropped, so a caller that lays its fields out separately (the event page shows
 *  street+locality on one line and the whole address on another) can keep them
 *  apart and still get the same de-duplication a single joined label gets. */

/** The location string for a space-constrained reader (cards, embeds): the place
 *  name, then the town. The name leads because it is the point of the pick —
 *  showing "Chicago, Illinois" for an event in Humboldt Park is the very bug this
 *  module exists to fix — and the town follows because a venue name alone does not
 *  answer "is this near me?", which is what a reader scanning a LIST is asking.
 *
 *  Nothing here shortens the name. It is tempting to, because records authored
 *  elsewhere put whole reverse-geocoded strings in that field, and a card would
 *  rather show "Om Being, London" than "Om Being, Amhurst Terrace, London, UK". But
 *  picking the town back out of one of those strings means guessing which comma
 *  segment is a street and which is a settlement, across every locale and every
 *  client's free text, and a rule for that is wrong often enough — and quietly
 *  enough — that it is not worth having. Measured over the index, shortening helps
 *  exactly 7 records that carry real address fields; everything else it does is a
 *  guess at somebody else's string.
 *
 *  So the fix belongs where the data is still structured, and it is in
 *  `buildLocationEntries`: a pick with no ISO country code now saves its town on the
 *  geo entry alongside its name, instead of discarding it. Records saved from here
 *  on need no guessing. The ones already in the index render whatever string they
 *  were given — long, sometimes, but never invented, and a card elides in CSS where
