## development

clone repo

```
pnpm install
```

set remote to false in `wrangler.jsonc` L22:

```
"remote": false
```

optionally if you want all current events to be displayed run this: (will take a few minutes)

```
pnpm backfill
```

start dev server:

```
pnpm run dev
```

## search (optional)

text search and "near me" are an opt-in feature backed by [meilisearch](https://www.meilisearch.com/). when it's not configured the app falls back to a d1 `LIKE` query for search and hides near-me, so you can skip this entirely.

to enable it locally, run a meili instance:

```
docker run -p 7700:7700 getmeili/meilisearch:v1.10
```

then set the search vars in `.env` (see `.env.example`):

- `SEARCH_URL` / `SEARCH_API_KEY` — the read path (search + near-me). use a read-only key.
- `SEARCH_SINK_URL` / `SEARCH_SINK_API_KEY` — the write path; the cron ingest forwards event records into the index. use the admin key. `SEARCH_SINK_INDEX` defaults to `events`.

the read and write keys are kept separate on purpose so the browser-facing read path never holds the admin key. the index is populated by the same cron ingest that fills d1, so once configured a `pnpm backfill` (or normal ingest) will fill it.

## contributing

open for contributions by all :)
