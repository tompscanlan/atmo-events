		// refreshStaleIdentities network tail. If this handler aborts before that
		// save runs, the cursor never advances and the next tick re-replays the same
		// window forever (the "redoing the same work" loop). A backlogged stream made
		// this certain: a 30s drain consumed the whole budget, leaving no room for a
		// tail that needs more, so the cursor was never persisted.
		//   DRAIN — contrail's internal deadline; how long we pull from jetstream.
		//           Kept well under the hard cap so the tail (incl. saveCursor) fits.
		//   HARD  — backstop only, for a genuine hang (e.g. a DID resolution that
		//           never returns). Sized never to pre-empt the cursor save in a
		//           normal cycle, and under the cron interval so ticks don't overlap.
		//           Scheduled invocations get ~15min wall-clock and this is I/O-bound,
		//           so the tail has ample room.
		// The HARD budget covers ARMING too: ensureInit runs INSIDE the race, ahead
		// of ingest (the sink must be armed before ingest upserts — see the ordering
		// rationale in $lib/contrail/index.ts). ensureInit's own settings fetch is
		// separately time-bounded, but that bound would be ADDITIVE to HARD if arming
		// were awaited before the race — a stalling search endpoint could then push a
		// tick past the cron interval and overlap the next one. Racing arming +
		// ingest together bounds the RACED SECTION by HARD, so a stalling search
		// endpoint can no longer push that section past the interval. (The whole
		// tick also spans the un-raced geocode stage below, so this
		// bounds the search-endpoint hazard, not the tick's total duration.)
